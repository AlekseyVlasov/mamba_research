# Mamba-Related Research

This repository contains the code and resources for research on **learnable inputs** in the context of **induction heads**. The current focus is on using the **Induction Heads Dataset** as a starting point for these experiments.

Future plans include expanding the research to explore modifications at each model layer. To enable this, we aim to transition to a more comprehensive dataset, such as **GLUE**, and a larger model with additional layers.
